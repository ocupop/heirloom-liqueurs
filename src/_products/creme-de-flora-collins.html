    <p><strong>The Tom Collins is the most well known Collins variation,
      implementing Gin as the chosen spirit.</strong></p><p>We chose Creme de Flora
      as the basis for a Collins cocktail, as the floral components in the liqueur
      expand upon the aromatic and floral presence of Gin in the original. Similar
      to a classic Gin Collins, the Creme de Flora Collins comprises a balance of
      floral, earthy, bright &amp; citrusy flavor.</p>

    <p>The history of the Collins is shrouded in mystery, though it is first
      mentioned in 1876 in Jerry Thomas&rsquo; Bar-Tender&rsquo;s Guide, the first
      published cocktail book.</p>

    <p>While journalists and cocktail historians may not agree on where and by
      whom the cocktail was first created, not many would argue against its
      importance. The Collins epitomizes the refreshing cocktail, and is light
      enough to be enjoyed with lunch (or brunch), but still punchy enough to hold
      up after dinner.&nbsp;</p>
