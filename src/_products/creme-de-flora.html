title: Creme De Flora
product_description: >-
  Intricately balanced floral aromas are derived from a select blend of flowers
  to create a bouquet of delight. Sweet and citrusy elderflowers dance joyously
  to The Rite of Spring alongside floral and earthy tones of marigold and orris
  root. The choir of eight sing harmoniously into the amber hued liquid,
  culminating with a gentle bittersweet crescendo.

          <p>Heirloom Creme de Flora was originally known as House Creme de Flora because we produced versions of it for restaurants and bars around the USA starting back in 2009. Heirloom Creme de Flora was created with a bouquet of vibrant flowers native to five continents including marigold and chamomile, resulting in a versatile liqueur that can serve as an aperitif or to provide nuance to a cocktail. Try it in an Aviation, Champagne Cocktail, or as a replacement for orange liqueur in a Sidecar.</p>
