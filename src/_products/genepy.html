product_description: >-
  This liqueur is composed of 28 barks, flowers, roots, seeds, leaves, and herbs
  , each one like a stroke of color in a liquid landscape. Inspired by alpine
  foragers and liquorists, it is all at once sharp yet cool, savory yet spicy,
  icey yet mellow and at its core, intensely herbal.

          <p>Heirloom Genepy gathers inspiration from a variety of Artemitis plants, and bridges the gap between robust varieties and more subtle variations of genepy. This modern Genepy was formulated with bright alpine botanicals, mellowed with honey, and produced with the Sunflower, a distinctly North American botanical. Intended to be used both as a mixer in cocktails, as well as enjoyed neat, the proof and sweetness are balanced for versatility and flexibility. Heirloom Genepy will showcase beautifully in classic cocktails, such as the Champs Elysees, Bijou and the Last Word.</p>

          <p>Historically produced in Switzerland, Italy and France by monks, farmers and explorers, styles vary region to region. They share a common thread of verdant, springtime aromatics. Some styles veer deep into larger, robust flavors, while others maintain a delicate, sweet profile.</p>
