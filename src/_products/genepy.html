product_description: >-
  This liqueur is composed of 28 barks, flowers, roots, seeds, leaves, and herbs
  , each one like a stroke of color in a liquid landscape. Inspired by alpine
  foragers and liquorists, it is all at once sharp yet cool, savory yet spicy,
  icey yet mellow and at its core, intensely herbal.
