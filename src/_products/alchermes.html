  Intensely aromatic, Alchermes recollects memories of long ago. On the nose
  it’s warm, earthy and gently floral. A cornucopia of cinnamon, cardamom,
  coriander and vanilla grace the palette while rose whispers it’s way
  throughout. A mysterious and inviting potion, Alchermes rewards each sip with
  a new experience.

          <p>The potion traveled from the middle east to Europe, where it became a highly prized beverage. Alchermes is colored with a small insect, Cochineal and is scarlet in color. It has been used not only as an enjoyable drink, but as a confectionary ingredient as well. Historic varieties were made with crushed pearls, silk and gold flakes.</p>

          <p>To fully enjoy its aromas, Alchermes is best served neat at room temperature. It is also recommended that Alchermes be served alongside or incorporated into Zuppa Inglese, strawberry shortcake, candied nuts, nopalitos, and coconut curry. An exceptional compliment to whiskies as well as grape and agave spirit cocktails. Use a dropper or atomizer to harness it&rsquo;s aromatic perfection as a garnish. Try it in a Scarlet 75, Oldest Pal, or Silk Sheets.</p>
