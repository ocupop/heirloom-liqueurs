title: Pineapple Amaro
product_description: >-
  Vastly unique, Pineapple Amaro is a bitter digestivo softened with a familiar
  tropical fruit. Warm notes of cinnamon, caramel and vanilla and hints of
  cherry cola fill the nose. Succulent tropical fruit and baked goods introduce
  the palette to a woodsy and earthy finish of bitter delight.
