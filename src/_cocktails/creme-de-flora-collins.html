title: Creme De Flora Collins
description_html: >-
  <p><strong>The Tom Collins is the most well known Collins variation,
  implementing Gin as the chosen spirit.</strong></p><p>We chose Creme de Flora
  as the basis for a Collins cocktail, as the floral components in the liqueur
  expand upon the aromatic and floral presence of Gin in the original. Similar
  to a classic Gin Collins, the Creme de Flora Collins comprises a balance of
  floral, earthy, bright &amp; citrusy flavor.</p>

  <p>The history of the Collins is shrouded in mystery, though it is first
  mentioned in 1876 in Jerry Thomas&rsquo; Bar-Tender&rsquo;s Guide, the first
  published cocktail book.</p>

  <p>While journalists and cocktail historians may not agree on where and by
  whom the cocktail was first created, not many would argue against its
  importance. The Collins epitomizes the refreshing cocktail, and is light
  enough to be enjoyed with lunch (or brunch), but still punchy enough to hold
  up after dinner.&nbsp;</p>
